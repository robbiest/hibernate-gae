#summary howto get Hibernate running on Google App Engine

= Installation =

_Btw. I'm assuming you are using Eclipse with Google App Engine plugin. If you are not, you probably need to figure some parts out yourself_

Datanucleus conflicts with Hibernate so you need to remove it from the program. You can do this by unchecking "Use Datanucleus JDO/JPA to access the datastore" from Project properties > Google > App Engine.  

In the same view you should enable Google Cloud SQL and configure it.

Then its time to add hibernate jars into project. Easiest way to do this is to add org.hibernate:hibernate-core-4.0.0.Final and org.hibernate:hibernate-entitymanager-4.0.0.Final Maven artifacts to your project. You can also copy the jars to war/WEB-INF/lib folder if you wish.
